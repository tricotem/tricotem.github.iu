	<h1>This is the <em>best</em> mothefucking website.</h1>

	<p>Really,it is</p>

	<h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need<br/>some styling?</h2>

	<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB<br/><span class="mother" >motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link.<br/>You think your fucking default fontis gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>

	<p><span class="wrong">WRONG</span>, motherfucker.</p>

	<h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>

	<p>let me describe the <em>real</em> perfect-ass websitewhich still has the glory of the past <span class="mother">motherfuckingwebsites</span>:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>she doesn't weight a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
		<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02KB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://www.google.com">Google home page</a></li>
		<li>Fits on your iphone 1st gen (althougt it doesn't work on your damn 16X32 tamagotchi)</li>
		<li>Looks <em>almost</em> the same on every screen</li>
		<li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <span class="min">well, kind of</span></li>
		<li>it's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it<span class="min"> but not everyone can read this text is Ant-Accessible</span></li>
		<li>Shit is <em>even more</em> legible than the fucking two precious versions - and it also has a cleanish style<br/>without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a>website</li>
		<li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a></li>
		<li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "open sans" <em>which btw weighs 15.21KB,wtf</em></li>
		<li>It doesn't load your glorious jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or<br/>any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML,CSS3 and JS.Keep it Vanilla!</li>
		<li>Doesn't include any tracking service<span class="min">this website does, but they who cares</span></li>
		<li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <em>JUST USE IT</em></li>
	    <li>Use fucking colors.</li>
	    <li>Links don't really need to keep that <span class="sh">shitty blue</span> the browser is giving them: nor that <span class="vio">violetish color</span><br/>when they are marked as visited. Just give them a nice <span class="multi">color</span></li>

	    <h2>Well guesswhat,motherfucker:</h2>

	    <p>this website is even better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">guy</a> and the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">guy before him</a>.</p>

	   <p>Why?</p>

  <ul>
        <li>It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> -so nobody can spy what w're serving to you (the page might be<br/>different for everyone,pshht!).</li>
        <li>It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain">gTLDs</a> available out there: website</li>
        <li>It uses the TLD, too: bestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="https://domainr.com">domainr</a> to do something cool too.</li>
        <li>It uses the kickassing <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a> CA(don't you see the gorgeaous green lock?)</li>
        <li>It runs on <a href="https://www.nginx.com/welcome-to-nginx/">nginx</a>: the best fucking web server instead of Apach server</li>
        <li>It uses <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/js/jquery-2.2.4.min.js">a custom version</a> of the awesome <a href="http://jquery.com">ultra-lightweightjQuery</a>/S</li>
        <li>It doesn't use a single media query <em>well, not query</em></li>
        <li>It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is<br/>outdated he will notice and maybe he will switch from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/fr-fr/hub/4230784/internet-explorer-help">the crap he uses</a> to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/">a much cooler browser</a></li>
        <li>It uses some cool technologies like javascript <img src="images/JS.png" width=16 height=16 alt="photo js">, CSS3<img src="images/css3.png" width=11 height=16 alt="photo css3"> and HTML5<img src="images/HTML5.png" width=16 height=16 alt="photo html5"></li>
        <li>It supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a></li>
        <li>It includes a Cache-control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwitch if you visit the<br/>website more than once</li>
        <li>It uses <a href="https://matomo.org">Piwik</a>,a free and Open Source analytics platform(we still love you Google,don't be mad at us)</li>
        <li>It allows universal access from every website via <a href="https://enable-cors.org">CORS</a></li>
        <li>It is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Accessible</a></li>
        <li>It's Open Source, freely available on <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/">GitHub</a>, and everybody can contribute to it</li>
        <li> It uses the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net">WTFPL - DO What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a>, which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:</li>

             <p> O. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.</p>

             <h2>Put even less contrast</h2>

             <p>Yeah,a #444 is cool but a #454545 is better.</p>

             <p>We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a motherfuckingwebsite.</p>

             <h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>

             <p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27<br/>inchesscreen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an Ant-compatible text either.</p>

             <h2>Put some pictures</h2>
                
                <p><img src="images/chat.jpg" width=320 height=212 alt="photo de chat" class="flottant"/>We're not looking a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a<br/>motherfuckingwebsite so include pictures to give a context.</p>

             	<p>The websiteshouldn't be overfield with pictures, but it<br/>should make the user happy while reading your nonsense<br/>words.</p>

             	
             	<p>You see fancy cat? He's happy, you should be too.</p>

             	<p class="autreparagraphe"><h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>

             	<p>But, this doesn't mean you should load your motherfucking website with shitty animations, instead keep it <br/>simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users!</p>


             	<p>Good design is as little as possible.</p>

             	<p>-Some german motherfucker on motherfuckerwebsite.com</p>

             	<p>That's not entirely tru, look at that motherfuckerwebsite. It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.</p>

             	<h2>Epilogue</h2>

             	<p>Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">motherfuckingwebsite</a> and the <br/><a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com">bettermotherfuckingwebsite</a>.</p>

             	<p>Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet(even<br/>though this is still the bestmotherfuckingwebsite), so go check'em out.</p>

             	<P>Seriously, follow some of the device we gave you theu'll"make the web great again"</p>
